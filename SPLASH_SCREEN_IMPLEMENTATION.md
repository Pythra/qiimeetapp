# Custom Splash Screen Implementation

## Overview
This implementation replaces the native splash screen and bootsplash with a custom React Native splash screen that stays visible until the Home.js component is fully initialized.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Dependencies
- `react-native-bootsplash` package removed
- Native splash screen configurations removed from Android

### 2. Custom Splash Screen Component
- **File**: `components/CustomSplashScreen.js`
- Features a gradient background with the app logo
- Stays visible until app initialization is complete

### 3. App.js Modifications
- Replaced bootsplash logic with custom splash screen state management
- Removed native splash screen hiding logic
- Custom splash screen shows until `appReady`, `initialRoute`, and `apiConnected` are all true

### 4. Home.js Modifications
- Removed initialization loading state
- Shows custom splash screen until context is initialized and data is loaded
- Custom splash screen displays the app logo during loading

### 5. AuthContext Modifications
- Removed loading screen display
- Context now renders children immediately when initialized
- Loading states are handled by individual components

### 6. Android Configuration
- Removed `Theme.App.SplashScreen` from styles.xml
- Removed splash screen drawable and color resources
- MainActivity now uses default `AppTheme`

## How It Works

1. **App Launch**: Custom splash screen shows immediately
2. **App Preparation**: Splash stays visible while app prepares (auth, routes, etc.)
3. **API Connection**: For authenticated users, splash stays until API connection is established
4. **Home.js Ready**: Splash disappears when Home.js component is fully initialized
5. **Smooth Transition**: 800ms delay ensures smooth transition from splash to main app

## Benefits

- **Full Control**: Complete control over splash screen appearance and timing
- **Better UX**: No jarring transitions between native and React Native splash screens
- **Consistent Branding**: Custom gradient and logo throughout the loading process
- **Performance**: No additional native dependencies or configurations
- **Maintainability**: Simple React Native component that's easy to modify

## Customization

To modify the splash screen appearance, edit `components/CustomSplashScreen.js`:
- Change gradient colors in the `colors` array
- Modify logo size and positioning
- Add animations or additional elements

## Cleanup

Run the cleanup script to remove bootsplash and clean up the project:
- **Linux/Mac**: `./cleanup-splash.sh`
- **Windows**: `cleanup-splash.bat`

## Notes

- The custom splash screen will show for at least 800ms to ensure smooth transitions
- A 15-second safety timeout prevents the splash from staying forever
- The splash screen automatically hides when Home.js initialization is complete
- No additional configuration needed for iOS or Android
